Isaiah 55:1-2 Invitation to the Needy 1â€œCome, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you without money, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk, without money and without cost! 2Why spend money on that which is not bread, and your labor on that which does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of foods.
